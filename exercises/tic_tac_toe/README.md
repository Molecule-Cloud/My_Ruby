# **Tic Tac Toe Game**

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The game ends when a player aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the grid is completely filled (a draw).

## **How to Play**
1. Player 1 uses `X`, and Player 2 uses `O`.
2. Players take turns choosing an empty cell in the 3×3 grid.
3. The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
